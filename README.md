# Deep-Learning-School-2024-part-2
In this repository I keep my homework, which I do as part of the second part of the MIPT Deep Learning School project. Second part of the course is focused on advanced networks for NLP and audio. 

* **Homework 1** was devoted to the ranking of questions [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com ) based on a semantic vector representation. Various embeddings and tokenizers were implemented, and the quality of aggregation was checked by various metrics.
* **Homework 2** included writing a classifier for 4 text topics based on the RNN architecture and its modifications (LSTM, GRU). High quality indicators (accuracy = 0.92) were obtained by iterating through hyperparameters and changing the number of hidden layers.
